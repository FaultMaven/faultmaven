## Executive Summary

### Purpose

This document defines the **Conversational Interaction Model** for FaultMaven - a comprehensive architecture that unifies three critical components:

1. **The 7-Phase Incident Resolution Lifecycle** - A structured progression from inquiry through post-incident documentation
2. **Four Distinct User Scenarios** - Technical Q&A, Investigation, Crisis Response, and Post-Incident Analysis
3. **Dual Conversational Modes** - Consultant Mode (reactive) and Lead Investigator Mode (proactive)

The design enables FaultMaven to adapt its behavior based on situational context while maintaining consistent, expert-level troubleshooting guidance.

### Key Innovations

1. **Dynamic Mode Switching**: Agent detects incident signals and requests permission to shift from reactive consultation to proactive investigation
2. **Lifecycle-Aware Conversations**: Agent understands where users are in the resolution journey and adapts methodology accordingly
3. **Evidence-Centric Progress**: Clear state persistence and phase transition triggers based on objective evidence collection
4. **Doctor-Patient Relationship**: Expert assistant that respects user autonomy while providing structured guidance

### Target Outcomes

- **User Clarity**: Users always understand what the agent is doing and why
- **Appropriate Urgency**: Fast iteration during incidents, deliberate analysis post-incident
- **Seamless Transitions**: Natural mode switches without jarring UX disruptions
- **Resumable Investigations**: Persistent state allows pausing and resuming complex troubleshooting
- **Knowledge Capture**: Automatic generation of runbooks and post-mortems for organizational learning

---

## System Context

### Existing Architecture Foundation

FaultMaven is built on three architectural pillars that this design extends:

#### 1. Evidence-Centric Troubleshooting System (v3.1.0)
- **Evidence Requests**: Structured requests with acquisition guidance
- **Multi-Dimensional Classification**: 5-dimension evidence analysis
- **Investigation Modes**: Active Incident vs Post-Mortem
- **Case Status Tracking**: 7-state lifecycle management

**Reference**: `/home/swhouse/projects/FaultMaven/docs/architecture/EVIDENCE_CENTRIC_TROUBLESHOOTING_DESIGN.md`

#### 2. Doctor/Patient Prompting Architecture
- **SRE 5-Phase Methodology**: Define Blast Radius → Timeline → Hypothesis → Validation → Solution
- **Sub-Agent System**: Specialized agents per phase (6 agents total)
- **Diagnostic State Tracking**: Server-side state maintained across conversations

**Models**: `/home/swhouse/projects/FaultMaven/faultmaven/models/doctor_patient.py`

#### 3. Case-Based Persistence
- **Case Model**: Persistent troubleshooting sessions with collaborative features
- **CaseDiagnosticState**: Server-side tracking of methodology progress
- **Message History**: Full conversation context with evidence tracking

**Models**: `/home/swhouse/projects/FaultMaven/faultmaven/models/case.py`

### Integration Points

This design **extends** existing architecture by:

1. **Mapping Lifecycle Phases** to existing SRE 5-phase methodology
2. **Defining Mode Transitions** within existing Investigation Mode framework
3. **Specifying Signal Detection** for automatic mode switching
4. **Detailing User Scenarios** as concrete workflow implementations

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principle: Doctor-Patient Relationship

FaultMaven operates as an **expert consultant**, not an autonomous agent:

- **User Retains Control**: Always asks permission before changing approach
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Explains what it's doing and why
- **Respectful Guidance**: Suggests but doesn't dictate
- **Adaptive Response**: Matches user urgency and complexity

### Conversational Design Tenets

#### 1. No Invisible State Changes
**Bad**: Agent silently switches to investigation mode
**Good**: "I notice this looks like an active incident. Would you like me to shift to structured troubleshooting to resolve this faster?"

#### 2. Explicit Phase Transitions
**Bad**: Agent moves to next phase automatically
**Good**: "We've identified the blast radius (3 services affected). Ready to establish the timeline of events?"

#### 3. Evidence Over Questions
**Bad**: "When did this start?"
**Good**: "Let's establish the timeline. Run `journalctl --since='2 hours ago' | grep ERROR` to check when errors began appearing."

#### 4. Mode-Appropriate Methodology
**Bad**: Same structured approach for casual questions and critical incidents
**Good**: Fast, mitigation-focused iteration during incidents; thorough, evidence-driven analysis post-incident

---

## Incident Resolution Lifecycle

### The 7-Phase Journey

The incident resolution lifecycle represents the **complete user journey** from first inquiry to organizational learning:

```
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6
Inquiry   Problem   Triage   Mitigation  Root      Solution  Documentation
          Definition         Recovery    Cause               Post-Mortem
```

#### Phase 0: Inquiry & Exploration (Steps 0-9)
**Purpose**: General Q&A, no active incident
**Agent Behavior**: Consultant Mode - answer questions, provide expertise
**Exit Condition**: User signals a problem OR agent detects incident indicators

**Example Interactions**:
- "What's the difference between Redis and Memcached?"
- "How do I configure rate limiting in NGINX?"
- "Tell me about circuit breaker patterns"

**Key Characteristics**:
- No evidence requests
- No phase progression
- Suggested actions focus on learning paths
- Can stay in Phase 0 indefinitely

#### Phase 1: Problem Definition & Impact Analysis (Steps 10-19)
**Purpose**: Understand the issue and scope the blast radius
**Agent Behavior**: Transition to Lead Investigator Mode (with permission)
**SRE Methodology Mapping**: Phase 0 (Intake) + Phase 1 (Blast Radius)

**Objectives**:
1. Confirm problem statement with user
2. Determine urgency level (normal/high/critical)
3. Identify affected systems/users (blast radius)
4. Set investigation mode (Active Incident vs Post-Mortem)

**Evidence Requests**:
- Error symptoms and manifestations
- Impact scope (how many users/services affected)
- Current system state

**Exit Condition**: Problem confirmed + blast radius defined

**State Transitions**:
```
CaseStatus: ACTIVE → INVESTIGATING
InvestigationMode: Set to ACTIVE_INCIDENT or POST_MORTEM
diagnostic_state.current_phase: 0 → 1
```

#### Phase 2: Triage & Correlation (Steps 20-29)
**Purpose**: Gather evidence and validate the problem exists
**Agent Behavior**: Systematic evidence collection
**SRE Methodology Mapping**: Phase 2 (Timeline)

**Objectives**:
1. Establish when the issue started
2. Identify recent changes (deployments, configs, code)
3. Correlate symptoms with timeline
4. Rule out false positives

**Evidence Requests**:
- Timeline data (when did it start?)
- Recent changes (what changed before symptoms?)
- Historical baselines (what's normal?)

**Exit Condition**: Timeline established + correlation identified

**State Transitions**:
```
diagnostic_state.current_phase: 1 → 2
evidence_requests: Timeline category marked complete
```

#### Phase 3: Mitigation & Service Recovery (Steps 30-39)
**Purpose**: Stop the bleeding, restore service availability
**Agent Behavior**: Action-focused, fast iteration
**Applies To**: Active Incident mode ONLY

**Objectives**:
1. Propose immediate mitigation actions
2. Guide service restoration
3. Implement temporary fixes
4. Validate service is back online

**Evidence Requests**:
- Mitigation action results
- Service health checks
- User-reported recovery

**Exit Condition**: Service restored OR mitigation failed (escalate)

**State Transitions**:
```
CaseStatus: INVESTIGATING → MITIGATED
InvestigationMode: ACTIVE_INCIDENT → POST_MORTEM (transition to RCA)
diagnostic_state.incident_mitigated: true
```

**Note**: Phase 3 is **skipped** in Post-Mortem mode (service already stable)

#### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis (Steps 40-49)
**Purpose**: Understand the underlying cause
**Agent Behavior**: Deliberate, evidence-driven investigation
**SRE Methodology Mapping**: Phase 3 (Hypothesis) + Phase 4 (Validation)

**Objectives**:
1. Formulate hypotheses based on evidence
2. Test hypotheses systematically
3. Rule out alternative explanations
4. Identify definitive root cause

**Evidence Requests**:
- Configuration verification
- Code analysis
- Dependency health checks
- Historical incident patterns

**Exit Condition**: Root cause identified with sufficient confidence

**Confidence Requirements**:
- **Active Incident (now Mitigated)**: Confidence score optional, mitigation success is primary
- **Post-Mortem**: Confidence score ≥0.75 required for resolution

**State Transitions**:
```
diagnostic_state.current_phase: 3 → 4
diagnostic_state.root_cause: Set to identified cause
diagnostic_state.overall_confidence_score: Set (if POST_MORTEM)
```

#### Phase 5: Long-Term Solution (Steps 50-59)
**Purpose**: Design permanent fix and prevention measures
**Agent Behavior**: Solution architecture and implementation guidance
**SRE Methodology Mapping**: Phase 5 (Solution)

**Objectives**:
1. Design permanent fix (not workaround)
2. Identify prevention measures
3. Propose architectural improvements
4. Estimate implementation complexity

**Evidence Requests**:
- Implementation validation
- Testing results
- Deployment success

**Exit Condition**: Solution implemented and verified

**State Transitions**:
```
CaseStatus: MITIGATED → RESOLVED
diagnostic_state.solution_implemented: true
diagnostic_state.case_resolved: true
```

#### Phase 6: Documentation & Post-Mortem (Steps 60+)
**Purpose**: Capture learnings for organizational knowledge
**Agent Behavior**: Generate artifacts, facilitate reflection
**Deliverables**: Case Report + Runbook

**Objectives**:
1. Offer case report generation
2. Offer runbook creation (if new issue type)
3. Capture lessons learned
4. Update knowledge base

**Artifacts**:

**Case Report Contents**:
- Problem description and timeline
- Evidence collected
- Root cause analysis (with confidence score)
- Solution applied and validated
- Investigation dead ends (ruled out)
- Lessons learned

**Runbook Contents** (if new issue):
- Issue identification (symptoms, detection)
- Quick diagnosis steps
- Resolution procedure (mitigation + permanent fix)
- Prevention measures
- Escalation contacts

**Exit Condition**: User accepts or declines artifact generation

**State Transitions**:
```
CaseStatus: RESOLVED → CLOSED
diagnostic_state.case_report_url: Set (if generated)
diagnostic_state.runbook_url: Set (if generated)
```

### Phase Progression Rules

#### Forward Progression
- Phases advance when objectives are **objectively met** (not turn-based)
- Evidence completeness triggers progression
- User can override and skip phases (with agent warning)

#### Backward Movement
- **Not allowed** - phases represent completed work
- Exception: New evidence contradicts previous conclusions → agent proposes hypothesis revision (stays in same phase)

#### Phase Skipping
- **Phase 3 skipped** in Post-Mortem mode (service already stable)
- User can request skipping with agent acknowledgment
- Agent warns of potential gaps

## Conversational Modes

### Mode 1: Consultant Mode (Default)

**Character**: Expert colleague, reactive, supportive

**Behavior**:
- Answers questions directly
- Provides explanations and examples
- Offers suggested actions for exploration
- No structured methodology
- User drives conversation direction

**Response Pattern**:
```
Answer: [Direct answer to question]

Want to learn more?
• [Related topic 1]
• [Related topic 2]
• [Practical example]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Technical Q&A
- Learning/exploration
- Best practices inquiry
- Tool selection guidance

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "What's the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?"

Agent: "Horizontal scaling (scaling out) adds more servers to distribute load,
while vertical scaling (scaling up) increases resources on existing servers.

Horizontal scaling:
• Better for stateless applications
• Higher availability (no single point of failure)
• More complex (load balancing, distributed state)
• Example: Adding more web server instances

Vertical scaling:
• Simpler architecture
• Easier for stateful applications
• Limited by hardware maximums
• Example: Upgrading from 4GB to 16GB RAM

Want to explore more?
• Learn about auto-scaling strategies
• Compare cloud provider scaling options
• See real-world scaling examples"
```

### Mode 2: Lead Investigator Mode

**Character**: Diagnostic expert, proactive, structured

**Behavior**:
- Drives investigation with structured methodology
- Generates evidence requests with acquisition guidance
- Adapts urgency based on situation
- Proposes phase transitions explicitly
- Tracks progress toward resolution

**Response Pattern (Active Incident)**:
```
Analysis: [Current understanding]

Immediate Action:
1. [Mitigation step 1]
2. [Mitigation step 2]

Evidence needed:
• [Evidence request 1 with commands]
• [Evidence request 2 with commands]
```

**Response Pattern (Post-Mortem)**:
```
Current Hypothesis: [Working theory]

Evidence needed to validate:
• [Evidence request 1 with commands]
• [Evidence request 2 with commands]

Alternative explanations:
• [Alternative 1] - less likely because [reason]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Active incident troubleshooting
- Post-incident root cause analysis
- Systematic problem investigation

### Mode Comparison Table

| Aspect | Consultant Mode | Lead Investigator Mode |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **User Control** | User drives | Agent guides (with permission) |
| **Structure** | Unstructured Q&A | Structured methodology |
| **Evidence** | Not tracked | Tracked and persistent |
| **Phase Progression** | None | Explicit phase transitions |
| **Urgency Adaptation** | Not applicable | Adapts to urgency level |
| **Suggested Actions** | Learning paths | Diagnostic commands |
| **Persistence** | Not critical | Critical (resumable) |
| **Exit Condition** | User stops asking | Investigation resolved or stalled |

---

## Mode Detection & Transition System

### Signal Detection Patterns

The agent continuously analyzes user input for **incident indicators**:

#### Strong Incident Signals (High Confidence)
- **Error Keywords**: "error", "failing", "broken", "down", "not working"
- **Urgency Language**: "urgent", "critical", "emergency", "production down"
- **Problem Statements**: "I have a problem", "something is wrong", "issue with"
- **Impact Indicators**: "users can't", "service unavailable", "data loss"

#### Moderate Incident Signals (Medium Confidence)
- **Symptom Descriptions**: "seeing weird behavior", "performance degraded"
- **Comparative Language**: "it used to work", "since yesterday", "after deployment"
- **Investigation Intent**: "trying to figure out", "debugging", "investigating"

#### Weak Signals (Low Confidence)
- **Vague Concerns**: "something seems off", "not sure what's happening"
- **Hypothetical Questions**: "what if X happened", "how would I debug Y"

### Mode Transition Protocol (3 Steps)

#### Step 1: Signal Detection
Agent detects incident signals and calculates confidence score:

```python
class IncidentSignalDetection(BaseModel):
    """Detection result for incident signals in user input"""

    confidence: float = Field(
        ...,
        ge=0.0,
        le=1.0,
        description="Confidence this is an active problem (0-1)"
    )

    signals_detected: List[str] = Field(
        ...,
        description="Specific signals that triggered detection"
    )

    suggested_mode: ConversationalMode = Field(
        ...,
        description="Recommended mode based on signals"
    )

    urgency_estimate: UrgencyLevel = Field(
        ...,
        description="Estimated urgency (NORMAL/HIGH/CRITICAL)"
    )

    should_request_transition: bool = Field(
        ...,
        description="Whether agent should request mode switch"
    )
```

**Thresholds**:
- Confidence ≥ 0.7 → Request transition
- Confidence 0.4-0.69 → Mention possibility, don't request
- Confidence < 0.4 → Continue in current mode

#### Step 2: Permission Request
Agent explicitly asks user for mode change:

**Template (High Urgency)**:
```
🚨 I notice this sounds like an active incident affecting production.

Would you like me to shift into **structured troubleshooting mode**?

I'll guide you through:
1. Defining the problem and impact
2. Establishing the timeline
3. Mitigating the issue quickly
4. Finding the root cause

This will help us resolve faster. Want to proceed? (yes/no)
```

**Template (Normal Urgency)**:
```
I notice you're investigating an issue. Would you like structured guidance?

I can walk you through a systematic approach:
• Define the problem scope
• Establish timeline of events
• Formulate and test hypotheses
• Identify root cause

Continue casually or use structured approach? (structured/casual)
```

**Template (Post-Incident)**:
```
This sounds like a post-incident analysis. Would you like help with a thorough RCA?

I can guide you through:
• Collecting comprehensive evidence
• Testing all viable hypotheses
• Identifying definitive root cause (with confidence scoring)
• Generating case report and runbook

Want structured RCA? (yes/no)
```

#### Step 3: Confirm and Engage
User responds with confirmation:

**Affirmative Responses** (trigger transition):
- "yes", "ok", "sure", "go ahead", "let's do it"
- "structured", "help me", "guide me"
- Click on "Yes, use structured troubleshooting" button

**Negative Responses** (stay in Consultant Mode):
- "no", "not now", "just answer my question"
- "casual", "keep it simple"
- No response after 2 turns

**State Transition**:
```python
# Before transition
conversational_mode = ConversationalMode.CONSULTANT
has_active_problem = False

# After user confirms
conversational_mode = ConversationalMode.LEAD_INVESTIGATOR
has_active_problem = True
problem_statement = "[extracted from user input]"
urgency_level = [detected urgency]
investigation_mode = ACTIVE_INCIDENT or POST_MORTEM
current_phase = 1  # Enter Phase 1: Problem Definition
```

### Reverse Transition (Lead Investigator → Consultant)

Users can exit structured mode at any time:

**User Signals**:
- Explicit: "stop", "cancel", "go back to casual mode"
- Implicit: Off-topic questions, disengagement, long pauses

**Agent Detection**:
```python
def detect_disengagement(
    recent_messages: List[Message],
    evidence_response_rate: float,
    turns_without_progress: int
) -> bool:
    """Detect if user is disengaging from structured investigation"""

    # User not responding to evidence requests
    if evidence_response_rate < 0.3 and turns_without_progress >= 3:
        return True

    # User asking off-topic questions
    off_topic_count = sum(1 for m in recent_messages[-3:]
                         if m.user_intent == UserIntent.OFF_TOPIC)
    if off_topic_count >= 2:
        return True

    return False
```

**Agent Response**:
```
I notice we haven't made progress in a few turns. Would you like to:

• Continue structured investigation (I'll adjust approach)
• Pause investigation for now (we can resume later)
• Switch back to casual Q&A mode

What works best for you?
```

### Mode Persistence

**Session Continuity**:
- Mode persists within a case (even across sessions)
- Case reopening defaults to last mode
- Evidence requests and progress preserved

**State Storage**:
```python
class CaseConversationalState(BaseModel):
    """Persistent conversational state for a case"""

    conversational_mode: ConversationalMode
    mode_transition_history: List[ModeTransition]
    last_mode_change_turn: int
    user_explicitly_set_mode: bool  # vs agent suggested
```

## User Scenario Workflows

### Scenario 1: Technical Q&A (Phase 0 Only)

**User Profile**: Engineer learning about technologies, no active problem

**Workflow**:

│ • Phase: INQUIRY (0)                 │
│ • Incident Signals: None detected    │
│ • Action: Answer question directly   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Agent Response:
"Redis and Memcached are both in-memory data stores, but they differ in key ways:

**Redis:**
• Supports complex data structures (lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes)
• Built-in persistence options (RDB snapshots, AOF logs)
• Pub/sub messaging
• Lua scripting
• Single-threaded but uses I/O multiplexing

**Memcached:**
• Simple key-value storage only
• No persistence (pure cache)
• Multi-threaded
• Simpler, lower memory overhead
• Faster for pure caching workloads

Choose Memcached if you need a simple, fast cache.
Choose Redis if you need:
• Data structure operations
• Persistence
• Pub/sub functionality

Want to explore more?
• Compare performance benchmarks
• Learn about Redis clustering
• See example use cases"

• Symptom: Latency spikes in API
• Impact: Unknown (need to quantify)
• Urgency: Normal

Let me confirm - is the API:
✓ Still functioning (just slower)?
✓ Affecting all endpoints or specific ones?
✓ Impacting all users or subset?

Evidence needed to scope the problem:

1️⃣ **Latency metrics baseline**
   What we need: Current vs normal latency

   Commands:
   • curl http://your-monitoring/api/latency?timerange=24h
   • kubectl top pods -n production (check resource usage)

   UI:
   • Datadog > API Dashboard > Latency Graph

   Expected: Compare current (e.g., p95: 800ms) vs baseline (p95: 200ms)

2️⃣ **Affected scope**
   What we need: Which endpoints showing spikes

   Commands:
   • grep 'response_time' /var/log/api.log | awk '$3 > 500'

   UI:
   • APM > Endpoint Performance Breakdown

   Expected: List of slow endpoints (if all = systemic, if few = localized)

What can you check first?"

   Expected: Timestamp when latency jumped (look for sudden spike)

2️⃣ **Recent changes before spike**

   Commands:
   • git log --since='3 days ago' --oneline (check recent deployments)
   • kubectl rollout history deployment/api

   Expected: Deployments, config changes, database migrations

3️⃣ **External factors**

   • Traffic increase? (check request volume)
   • Database issues? (check DB latency)
   • Network changes? (check infrastructure logs)

• Incident: Database outage yesterday
• Current state: Service stable now
• Goal: Understand root cause completely

Let's gather comprehensive evidence. We'll test multiple hypotheses systematically.

**Evidence Collection - Phase 1: Incident Context**

1️⃣ **Incident timeline and symptoms**

   What we need:
   • When did database go down? (exact timestamp)
   • What were the symptoms? (connection timeouts, query errors, etc)
   • When was service restored? (timeline duration)

   Sources:
   • Incident report or tickets
   • Monitoring dashboard screenshots
   • Chat logs from incident response

2️⃣ **Database state during incident**

   Commands:
   ```bash
   # Historical database logs (if retained)
   journalctl -u postgresql --since='yesterday 00:00' --until='yesterday 23:59'

   # Check if metrics are retained
   curl http://monitoring/db-metrics?date=yesterday
   ```

   Expected: Connection count, query latency, error rates, resource usage

3️⃣ **Events before outage**

   What changed in 24h before outage:
   • Application deployments
   • Database configuration changes
   • Infrastructure changes (scaling, migrations)
   • Traffic patterns (sudden spike?)

Key findings:
✓ Duration: 84 minutes (14:23 - 15:47 UTC)
✓ Symptom: Connection timeouts
✓ Root log: `max_connections reached (100)`
✓ No recent deployments

🤔 **Initial Hypothesis**: Connection pool exhaustion

**Working Theory**:
Application failed to close connections → pool leaked → hit 100 limit → new connections rejected

**Confidence**: 0.45 (needs validation)

**What would increase confidence**:

1️⃣ **Connection growth pattern**

   Commands:
   ```bash
   # Connection count over time (if metrics retained)

   ```

   Expected: See connections gradually increase to 100

2️⃣ **Application connection handling**

   Check:
   • Connection pool configuration (max pool size)
   • Are connections being closed properly?
   • Any long-running queries?

3️⃣ **Alternative explanations to rule out**

   Could it be:
   • Traffic spike? (check request volume)
   • Slow queries? (check query execution times)
   • Database resource limits? (CPU, memory, disk)

"💡 **Root Cause Identified**

🎯 **Root Cause**: Connection starvation from slow queries + config mismatch

**Complete Picture**:
1. App configured for 200 connections
2. Database max_connections = 100 (misconfiguration)
3. Slow query (5 min) holds connections open
4. Connections accumulated over 2 hours (20 → 100)
5. Once at 100, new connections rejected
6. Cascading failure

**Confidence**: 0.85 (High)

**Supporting Evidence**:
✓ Steady connection growth to 100 (not sudden spike)
✓ Log: max_connections reached
✓ App pool (200) > DB limit (100) - mismatch
✓ Slow query holds connections open
✓ No traffic spike (rules out load issue)

**Missing Evidence** (would increase to 0.95):
✗ Exact slow query identification
✗ Why query became slow (code change? data growth?)

**Alternative Explanations** (ruled out):
❌ Traffic spike - No evidence in request volume
❌ Connection leak - Connections were closed (just slowly)
❌ Resource exhaustion - CPU/memory normal

"🔧 **Phase 5: Long-Term Solution**

**Three-Part Fix** (priority order):

**1. Immediate: Fix Configuration Mismatch** (High Priority)
```sql
-- Increase database max_connections
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 250;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
Why: App pool (200) must be < DB limit (250) with buffer

**2. Short-term: Optimize Slow Query** (High Priority)
```sql
-- Add missing index (if query is SELECT with WHERE clause)
CREATE INDEX idx_table_column ON table_name(column_name);

-- Or add query timeout
ALTER DATABASE your_db SET statement_timeout = '30s';
```
Why: 5-minute queries are never acceptable

**3. Long-term: Add Connection Pool Monitoring** (Medium Priority)
```yaml
# Add alert when connections > 80%
alert: DatabaseConnectionsHigh
expr: pg_stat_database_numbackends / max_connections > 0.8
for: 5m
```
Why: Detect before hitting limit

**Prevention Measures**:
• Add config validation (app pool < DB max_connections)
• Set query timeout (prevent runaway queries)
• Monitor connection pool usage
• Add capacity alert at 80%

**Implementation Estimate**:
• Config fix: 5 minutes
• Query optimization: 1-2 hours (depends on query complexity)

📋 **Case Report Generated**

**Database Outage Post-Mortem - October 7, 2025**

**Incident Summary**:
• Duration: 84 minutes (14:23 - 15:47 UTC)
• Impact: All database-dependent services unavailable
• Root Cause: Connection pool exhaustion due to config mismatch + slow queries

**Timeline**:
• 12:23 UTC: Slow query (5 min) begins executing regularly
• 12:23-14:23: Connections accumulate (20 → 100)
• 14:23 UTC: max_connections (100) reached
• 14:23-15:47: Service degraded (connection timeouts)
• 15:47 UTC: Service restored (manual intervention)

**Root Cause** (Confidence: 0.85):
1. Configuration mismatch: App pool=200, DB max_connections=100
2. Slow query (5 min) held connections open longer than expected
3. Gradual accumulation hit hard limit
4. Cascading connection rejections

**Solution Implemented**:
• Increased max_connections to 250
• Optimized slow query (added index)
• Added connection pool monitoring (alert at 80%)
• Added query timeout (30s)

**Lessons Learned**:
• Validate app pool < DB connections in config validation
• Monitor connection pool usage proactively
• Query timeouts prevent resource exhaustion

📖 **Runbook Generated**

**Runbook: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**

**Detection**:
Symptoms:
• "Connection timeout" errors in application logs
• Database connections at max_connections limit
• Gradual service degradation (not sudden failure)

Monitoring:
• Alert: DatabaseConnectionsHigh (> 80% of max)
• Dashboard: DB Connections > Connections over time

**Quick Diagnosis**:
```bash
# 1. Check current connection count
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# 2. Check max_connections limit
psql -c "SHOW max_connections;"

# 3. Identify long-running queries
psql -c "SELECT pid, now() - query_start as duration, query
         FROM pg_stat_activity
         WHERE state = 'active'
         ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

**Resolution** (Mitigation + Permanent Fix):

**Immediate Mitigation** (if connections at limit):
```bash
# Kill long-running queries (CAUTION: verify before killing)
psql -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
         FROM pg_stat_activity
         WHERE state = 'active'
         AND now() - query_start > interval '5 minutes';"
```

**Permanent Fix**:
1. Increase max_connections (if app pool > DB limit)
2. Optimize slow queries (add indexes, tune queries)
3. Add query timeout (prevent runaway queries)
4. Monitor connection pool usage (alert before limit)

**Prevention**:
• Config validation: Ensure app_pool_size < db_max_connections - 10
• Query timeout: Set statement_timeout = '30s'
• Monitoring: Alert at 80% connection usage
• Capacity planning: Review connection limits quarterly

**Escalation**:
• If mitigation fails: Contact Database Team (#db-team)
• If queries can't be killed: Database restart required (Platform Lead approval)

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Case 1: User Switches Topic Mid-Investigation

**Scenario**: User in Phase 4 (Root Cause) suddenly asks unrelated question

**User**: "By the way, what's the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?"

**Detection**:
```python
# QueryClassificationEngine detects off-topic intent
classification = {
    "user_intent": UserIntent.OFF_TOPIC,
    "topic_relevance": 0.1,  # Low relevance to current investigation
    "conversational_mode": ConversationalMode.LEAD_INVESTIGATOR,
    "current_phase": LifecyclePhase.ROOT_CAUSE
}
```

**Agent Response Strategy**:
1. **Answer the question** (respect user autonomy)
2. **Acknowledge context switch**
3. **Offer to resume investigation**

**Response**:
```
Docker and Kubernetes serve different purposes:

**Docker**: Containerization platform
• Packages apps with dependencies
• Runs containers on single host
• Good for development and simple deployments

**Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
• Manages containers across many hosts
• Auto-scaling, load balancing, self-healing
• Production-grade distributed systems

---

We're currently investigating the database connection issue (Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis).

Want to:
• Continue RCA (we were testing the slow query hypothesis)
• Pause investigation and explore more?

[Continue RCA] [Keep Exploring]
```

**State Updates**:
```python
conversational_state.off_topic_turns += 1

# If off_topic_turns >= 2, trigger disengagement detection
if conversational_state.off_topic_turns >= 2:
    agent_suggests_pause_or_mode_switch()
```

---

### Edge Case 2: Multiple Concurrent Issues

**Scenario**: User reports second issue while first investigation ongoing

**User**: "Also, our monitoring dashboard is down. Should we handle that first?"

**Detection**:
```python
# Signal detector identifies new incident
new_incident = {
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "signals": ["monitoring dashboard is down", "should we handle first"],
    "urgency": UrgencyLevel.HIGH,
    "is_new_issue": True  # Distinct from current investigation
}
```

**Agent Response Strategy**:
1. **Acknowledge new issue**
2. **Assess relative priority**
3. **Offer options** (switch, parallel, sequential)

**Response**:
```
🚨 New incident detected: Monitoring dashboard down

**Current investigation**: Database connection exhaustion (Phase 4: Root Cause)
**New issue**: Monitoring dashboard outage

**Priority Assessment**:
• Database: Mitigated (service restored), doing RCA
• Monitoring: Active outage, affects visibility

**Options**:

1️⃣ **Pause current RCA, handle monitoring first** (Recommended)
   • Monitoring down is active incident
   • Database RCA can wait (service is stable)
   • We'll resume database investigation after

2️⃣ **Create new case for monitoring, continue this one**
   • Keep investigations separate
   • You handle monitoring, I'll continue this RCA asynchronously

3️⃣ **Finish database RCA first, then monitoring**
   • Only if monitoring is not critical

What's your priority?

[Switch to Monitoring] [Create New Case] [Finish This First]
```

**State Management**:
```python
if user_selects_switch_to_monitoring:
    # Pause current case
    current_case.status = CaseStatus.STALLED
    current_case.metadata["stall_reason"] = "User switched to higher priority incident"
    current_case.metadata["paused_at_phase"] = LifecyclePhase.ROOT_CAUSE

    # Create new case for monitoring issue
    new_case = create_case(
        title="Monitoring Dashboard Outage",
        priority=CasePriority.HIGH,
        parent_case_id=current_case.case_id  # Link for context
    )

    # Start new investigation
    new_case.conversational_state.conversational_mode = ConversationalMode.LEAD_INVESTIGATOR
    new_case.conversational_state.lifecycle_phase = LifecyclePhase.PROBLEM_DEFINITION
```

---

### Edge Case 3: User Overrides Agent Suggestions

**Scenario**: Agent suggests Phase 2 (Timeline), user wants to jump to Phase 4 (Root Cause)

**Agent**: "Ready to establish the timeline?"

**User**: "No, I already know when it started. Let's just find the root cause."

**Detection**:
```python
# Detect user override intent
override_detection = {
    "user_intent": UserIntent.PHASE_OVERRIDE,
    "proposed_phase": LifecyclePhase.TRIAGE,
    "user_requested_phase": LifecyclePhase.ROOT_CAUSE,
    "confidence": 0.9
}
```

**Agent Response Strategy**:
1. **Acknowledge user's preference**
2. **Warn about potential gaps**
3. **Proceed with user's choice**

**Response**:
```
Understood - you want to skip timeline and jump to root cause analysis.

⚠️ **Heads up**: Skipping timeline means we won't have:
• When the issue started (correlation with changes)
• Recent deployments/configs that may be related
• Pattern identification (intermittent vs constant)

This may reduce confidence in root cause conclusion.

Want to proceed with RCA anyway?

[Yes - Skip Timeline] [Quick Timeline Check First]
```

**State Updates**:
```python
if user_confirms_skip:
    # Record skip in metadata
    diagnostic_state.metadata["skipped_phases"] = [LifecyclePhase.TRIAGE]
    diagnostic_state.metadata["skip_reason"] = "User already knows timeline"

    # Advance to requested phase
    conversational_state.lifecycle_phase = LifecyclePhase.ROOT_CAUSE

    # Adjust confidence requirements (may need lower threshold)
    diagnostic_state.overall_confidence_threshold = 0.70  # Lower from 0.75
```

---

### Edge Case 4: Investigation Resumption After Long Pause

**Scenario**: User returns to case after 24+ hours, needs context refresh

**User**: "Hey, can we continue the database investigation?"

**Detection**:
```python
# Detect case resumption
resumption = {
    "last_activity_hours": 26,
    "conversational_mode": ConversationalMode.LEAD_INVESTIGATOR,
    "lifecycle_phase": LifecyclePhase.ROOT_CAUSE,
    "evidence_requests_pending": 2,
    "context_refresh_needed": True
}
```

**Agent Response Strategy**:
1. **Welcome back**
2. **Provide context summary**
3. **Show progress so far**
4. **Offer to resume or restart**

**Response**:
```
Welcome back! Let's resume the database connection investigation.

📋 **Quick Recap** (Where we left off 26 hours ago):

**Problem**: Database connection exhaustion
**Status**: Service mitigated (max_connections increased to 250)
**Progress**: Phase 4 - Root Cause Analysis
**Current Hypothesis**: Slow queries holding connections open

**What we've learned**:
✓ Connections grew 20 → 100 over 2 hours
✓ App pool (200) > DB limit (100) - mismatch found
✓ 5-minute slow query identified
✗ Exact slow query not yet analyzed
✗ Why query became slow - unknown

**Next Steps**:
• Identify the specific slow query
• Analyze why it's slow (missing index, data growth, etc)
• Design permanent fix

**Pending Evidence Requests** (2):
1. Slow query identification (SQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
2. Query performance history

Want to continue where we left off?

[Continue Investigation] [Start Fresh RCA] [Just Ask Questions]
```

**State Restoration**:
```python
# Restore context
case = load_case(case_id)
conversational_state = case.diagnostic_state.conversational_state

# Check if state is still valid (evidence may have expired)
validate_evidence_freshness(case.diagnostic_state.evidence_provided)

# Refresh knowledge base (new runbooks may exist)
check_for_new_knowledge(case.context.problem_description)

# Resume at last phase
agent_continues_from_phase(conversational_state.lifecycle_phase)
```

---

### Edge Case 5: Agent's Hypothesis Completely Wrong

**Scenario**: Agent proposes wrong hypothesis, evidence strongly refutes it

**Agent**: "Based on evidence, root cause is likely memory leak in caching layer."

**User**: "No, I checked - cache memory usage is normal (30%). Logs show disk I/O errors."

**Detection**:
```python
# Evidence classification detects strong refutation
evidence_classification = {
    "evidence_type": EvidenceType.REFUTING,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "refutes_hypothesis": "memory_leak_in_cache",
    "new_direction": "disk_io_issues",
    "requires_confirmation": True
}
```

**Agent Response Strategy**:
1. **Acknowledge refutation**
2. **Thank user for correction**
3. **Revise hypothesis immediately**
4. **Adjust confidence**

**Response**:
```
⚠️ **Hypothesis Refuted**

You're right - cache memory at 30% rules out memory leak.
Thank you for the correction!

**Previous (Wrong) Hypothesis**: Memory leak in caching layer
**Refuting Evidence**: Cache memory normal, disk I/O errors in logs

**Revised Hypothesis**: Disk I/O bottleneck or failure

This changes our investigation direction:

**New Focus**:
• Disk health (SMART status, error rates)
• Disk I/O latency (iostat, iotop)
• Filesystem issues (full disk, inode exhaustion)

**Confidence Update**: 0.75 → 0.50 (restarting hypothesis validation)

Evidence needed:

1️⃣ **Disk health status**
   ```bash
   sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
   df -h  # Check disk usage
   ```

2️⃣ **I/O statistics**
   ```bash
   iostat -x 1 10  # 10 seconds of I/O stats
   ```

3️⃣ **Error logs**
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i 'error\|fail'
   journalctl -u postgresql | grep 'I/O'
   ```

Let's test this new direction. What do the disk health checks show?
```

**State Updates**:
```python
# Record dead-end hypothesis
dead_end = DeadEnd(
    hypothesis="Memory leak in caching layer",
    evidence_checked=["cache_memory_usage"],
    why_ruled_out="Cache memory at 30%, within normal range",
    turn_number=current_turn,
    confidence_eliminated=0.95
)
diagnostic_state.investigation_dead_ends.append(dead_end)

# Update current hypothesis
diagnostic_state.hypotheses = [
    {
        "hypothesis": "Disk I/O bottleneck or disk failure",
        "confidence": 0.50,
        "supporting_evidence": ["disk I/O errors in logs"],
        "status": "testing"
    }
]

# Lower overall confidence (incorrect hypothesis path)
diagnostic_state.overall_confidence_score = 0.50
```

### Error Handling Patterns

#### Timeout Handling

```python
class TimeoutError(Exception):
    """LLM request timeout"""
    pass

async def handle_llm_timeout():
    """When LLM provider times out"""

    return AgentResponse(
        content=(
            "⏱️ Request timed out. This usually means the LLM is overloaded.\n\n"
            "Your investigation is saved. You can:\n"
            "• Try again in a moment\n"
            "• Continue where you left off\n"
            "• Ask a simpler question"
        ),
        response_type=ResponseType.ERROR,
        metadata={
            "error_type": "timeout",
            "recovery_options": ["retry", "resume", "simplify"]
        }
    )
```

#### Invalid State Transitions

```python
def validate_phase_transition(current_phase, proposed_phase):
    """Validate phase transition is legal"""

    # Can't go backward
    if proposed_phase < current_phase:
        raise InvalidTransitionError(
            f"Cannot move backward from {current_phase} to {proposed_phase}"
        )

    # Can't skip more than 1 phase without user override
    if proposed_phase > current_phase + 1:
        requires_user_confirmation = True

    # Phase 3 can be skipped in POST_MORTEM mode
    if current_phase == LifecyclePhase.TRIAGE and \
       proposed_phase == LifecyclePhase.ROOT_CAUSE and \
       investigation_mode == InvestigationMode.POST_MORTEM:
        return True  # Valid skip

    return True
```

#### Data Corruption Recovery

```python
async def recover_from_corrupted_state(case_id):
    """Recover when case state is corrupted"""

    # Load from backup
    backup_state = load_backup_state(case_id)

    if backup_state:
        # Restore from most recent valid backup
        restore_state(case_id, backup_state)
        return "State restored from backup"

    # Fallback: Reset to safe defaults
    safe_state = CaseDiagnosticState(
        conversational_state=CaseConversationalState(
            conversational_mode=ConversationalMode.CONSULTANT,
            lifecycle_phase=LifecyclePhase.INQUIRY
        )
    )

    restore_state(case_id, safe_state)
    return "State reset to defaults - investigation can continue from scratch"
```

## Appendix C: Prompt Engineering Guidelines

### Mode-Specific System Prompts

#### Consultant Mode Prompt

```
You are FaultMaven, an expert SRE consultant.

MODE: Consultant Mode
BEHAVIOR: Reactive, supportive, educational

Your role:
• Answer user questions directly and thoroughly
• Provide examples and best practices
• Offer suggested learning paths
• Do NOT push structured troubleshooting unless user has a problem

Guidelines:
• Keep tone conversational and friendly
• Provide code examples when relevant
• Suggest related topics for exploration
• If you detect a problem, SUGGEST (don't insist) structured troubleshooting

DO NOT:
• Generate evidence requests (only in Lead Investigator mode)
• Track investigation phases (only in Lead Investigator mode)
• Push users into troubleshooting mode

DETECTION:
If user mentions a problem (errors, issues, incidents), analyze signals:
• Calculate confidence (0-1)
• If confidence ≥ 0.7, generate mode transition request
• If confidence 0.4-0.69, mention possibility
• If confidence < 0.4, continue answering

Example:
User: "What's the difference between sync and async in Python?"
You: [Explain directly, offer learning paths, stay in Consultant mode]

User: "Our API is timing out for some users"
You: [Detect signal, confidence 0.8, request transition to Lead Investigator mode]
```

#### Lead Investigator Mode Prompt (ACTIVE_INCIDENT)

```
You are FaultMaven, an expert SRE investigator.

MODE: Lead Investigator (ACTIVE_INCIDENT)
URGENCY: CRITICAL
METHODOLOGY: Fast iteration, mitigation first

Your role:
• Guide user through rapid incident response
• Generate evidence requests with commands
• Prioritize service restoration over certainty
• Drive toward mitigation quickly

Current Phase: {current_phase}
Phase Objectives:
{phase_objectives}

Guidelines:
• ONE evidence request at a time (speed over completeness)
• Commands should be copy-paste ready
• Explain WHY evidence is needed (builds trust)
• Propose quick mitigation when identified
• Skip phases if timeline is obvious

Evidence Format:
🔴 **IMMEDIATE ACTION**

Run NOW:
```bash
[command]
```

Expected: [what to look for]

After service restored:
• Transition to POST_MORTEM mode
• Continue with thorough RCA

DO NOT:
• Request comprehensive evidence (too slow)
• Require high confidence (mitigation > certainty)
• Skip mitigation phase

Example:
User: "Payment API completely down!"
You: [Request pod health check, suggest rollback if recent deployment]
```

#### Lead Investigator Mode Prompt (POST_MORTEM)

```
You are FaultMaven, an expert SRE investigator.

MODE: Lead Investigator (POST_MORTEM)
URGENCY: NORMAL
METHODOLOGY: Thorough analysis, high confidence

Your role:
• Guide user through comprehensive RCA
• Generate evidence requests (2-3 per turn)
• Test multiple hypotheses systematically
• Require confidence ≥ 0.75 for root cause conclusions

Current Phase: {current_phase}
Phase Objectives:
{phase_objectives}

Guidelines:
• Comprehensive evidence collection (no rush)
• Multiple evidence requests per turn (2-3)
• Test all viable hypotheses
• Explicit confidence scoring
• Document dead-ends and alternatives

Evidence Format:
Evidence needed for root cause analysis:

1️⃣ **[Category]: [What's needed]**

   Why: [Rationale]

   Commands:
   • [command 1]
   • [command 2]

   Expected: [what to look for]

2️⃣ [Next evidence request]

Root Cause Conclusions:
When proposing root cause, include:
• Confidence score (0-1)
• Supporting evidence list
• Missing evidence list
• Alternative explanations (with why less likely)
• Caveats/assumptions

Confidence Rubric:
0.9-1.0: Direct evidence confirms
0.75-0.89: Strong supporting evidence, minor gaps
0.5-0.74: Circumstantial evidence, notable gaps
< 0.5: Insufficient for conclusion

DO NOT:
• Rush to conclusions (service is stable)
• Accept confidence < 0.75
• Skip alternative hypothesis testing

Example:
User: "Want to understand yesterday's outage"
You: [Start at Phase 4, request comprehensive evidence, test multiple hypotheses]
```
