"""Data-Driven and Opportunistic Investigation Engine

This module implements the data-driven investigation system: instead of
rigid phase orchestration, the engine completes milestones
opportunistically based on data availability.

Key Design Principles:
- Process-Agnostic: No rigid phase transitions - milestones complete when data is available
- Opportunistic: Multiple milestones can complete in one turn
- Data-Driven Context: Status-based prompt generation based on available data
- Progress tracked via InvestigationProgress

Design Reference:
- docs/architecture/milestone-based-investigation-framework.md


Architecture:
- Process turn → Generate status-based prompt → Invoke LLM → Process response
- Update milestones based on LLM state_updates
- Track turn progress for analytics
- Automatic status transitions (INVESTIGATING → RESOLVED)
