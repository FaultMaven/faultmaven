"""ChromaDB client deployment gate.

The vector store has the same deployment split as Redis
(:mod:`faultmaven.infrastructure.redis_client`): standalone runs an in-process
``PersistentClient``; cloud runs a shared ChromaDB server over HTTP. A cloud
process that silently substitutes a ``PersistentClient`` writes vectors into
its own container filesystem — for a web pod that is per-replica search
results, and for a Job (``kb_seed``) it is durable-state corruption: the
Postgres rows land in the shared database while the vectors die with the pod,
leaving a KB that lists fine and searches empty (#901).

This module holds the pieces both client-acquisition paths (the container
provider and ``KnowledgeIngester``) and the deployment coherence gate share,
so they cannot drift apart on what "external ChromaDB is configured" means —
the #881 lesson applied to the vector store.
